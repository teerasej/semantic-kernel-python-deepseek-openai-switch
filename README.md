# Deepseek or OpenAI? both are good in Semantic Kernel

This project is a simple example of how to use the OpenAI API to generate text using the GPT-3 model. It uses the Semantic Kernel as a way to generate text. Deepseek is a good alternative to OpenAI. So if you design a good flow of the Semantic Kernel, you can use Deepseek as well.
